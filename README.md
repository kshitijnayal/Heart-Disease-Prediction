# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle features. Designed with a strong emphasis on data validation, model testing, and interpretability â€” essential aspects of a software quality analyst's workflow.

##   QA-Focused Highlights
- Performed **extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate insights to detect anomalies and data drift.
- Ensured **feature standardization** and separation of dependent/independent variables to avoid data leakage.
- Applied **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier for prediction, followed by systematic model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Focused on **model traceability and test reproducibility**, key for ensuring reliability in production-quality systems.

##   Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KNN, train-test split, preprocessing)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

##   Workflow Summary

1. **Data Exploration & Validation**
   - Analyzed feature distribution, outliers, and inter-feature correlations.
   - Verified data integrity before model input.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Separated features and target variables.
   - Applied standard scaling to normalize input data.

3. **Model Building: KNN**
   - Trained and tested using a train-test split.
   - Optimized and evaluated performance using:
     - Accuracy Score
     - Confusion Matrix

4. **Results & Evaluation**
   - Assessed model behavior on unseen data.
   - Used visualization tools to detect classification errors and edge cases.

##   QA-Oriented Takeaways
- Built with **repeatability** and **testing discipline** in mind.
- Emphasized **clear diagnostic outputs** (e.g., confusion matrix heatmaps) for explainability.
- Provided a controlled ML experiment setup aligned with QA standards.
